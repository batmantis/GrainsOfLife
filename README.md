# Grains of Life

Grains of Life is a hackathon project to create a grain synthesizer using the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation.  Each square on the grid corresponds to a tone in the pentatonic scale.  Running the simulation generates music according to the Game of Life logic.

Grains of Life is built using vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS, and timbre.js.
